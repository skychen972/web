<h2> 
  Rules for Aromatic Stability
    </h2>
      <p> A molecule is stabilized by aromaticity and is aromatic when it meets two conditions. It must have a ring of continously overlapping p orbitals meaning it's planar and must fit Huckel's rule. Huckel's rule says a molecule has 4n + 2 pi electrons in the ring. Molecules like cyclooctateraene appear to be aromatic because it's drawn in a ring. However, the actual confirmation is more like a boat and it has 8 pi electron which doesn't fit Huckel's rule.

      <h2> 
          Why is it important?
      </h2>
      <p> Aromatic substances have unusually high stability due to the ring of pi bonds. Therefore, they're much less reactive compared compounds with aromaticity. This makes them useful as industrial solvents for nonpolar solutes. The arene will react via an electrophilic aromatic substitution where a hydrogen is replaced by the reactant rather than a double bond being broken.

      <p> The most famous example would be benzene which can be used as a nonpolar solvent and has a lot of derivitives like toluene (another solvent). If we oxidize cyclooctateraene into its 2+ cation, it becomes aromatic. This is an exanple of an aromatic ion. Other examples include the cyclopropenyl cation and cycloheptatrienyl cation. Naphtalene is the simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (more than one ring). Our bodies contain a lot of molecules with these aromatic structure including pyrimidine, (DNA), thymine (DNA), and histamine (immune response).
